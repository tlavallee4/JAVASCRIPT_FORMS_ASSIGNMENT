# Reflection

## Can I explain what my code does?

In the HTML file, a form was created using input types like a textbox, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdown menus, number selectors, date selector, and a button. In the javascript file it is used to make sure the inputs are valid and submitted properly, alerting if something is blank or left unchecked. It uses functions, event listeners, alerts, etc. 

## What was my coding process?

My coding process was to create basic HTML to work off of first and build onto it after. I then styled it to my liking and valuated each box at a time. I based my project on past assignments/labs created, school notes, and one website for aria. 

## What challenges did I have?

I had troubles with the hasCheckedOption function. I tried many different if and for statements until this one finally worked. the ".checked" had me confused for a long time. Took me a while to find that it was something that could be used. I think I ended up finding it on w3schools. I also have some challenges understanding how to organize the HTML id, name, values.

## What would I do differently now?

I think I want to spend some more time on side projects learning different properties I could use and how to organize each file better. I find I learn better the more I do something hands on. If I were to start this assignment over I think I would structure a better plan for organzation.
